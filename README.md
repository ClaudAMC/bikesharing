# bikesharing

## Overview
Kate and I want to use the data from Citibike in New York City to convince investors that a similar program in Des Moines would be a good idea. We used Tableau to generate visualizations of the data we feel is transferrable to Des Moines and helps our potential investors see our vision clearly.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show our investors how a bike sharing program similar to the one in New York City can be transferable to Des Moines.

## Analysis

Intially the Citibike data was changed so that trip duration could be represented in minutes as opposed to seconds. This analysis can be found in the following jupyter notebook:

The remaining analysis was done in Tableau where the visualizations to follow were created. The Tableau Public link can be found below:

## Results

The Images below tell the story of our analysis.

This image shows us the number of riders in the month of August broken down by genders. This lets us get a sense of how many riders we can expect during a high peak month. Creating a ratio of this based on population in NYC vs that of Des Moines can give us an idea of how many riders proportional to the population of Des Moines we could expect. The breakdown by gender also tells us that males are the highest users of this service; this can inform initial marketing strategies that target males in Des Moines to join the program initally, a following campaign could try and attract more female once the program is up and running.

This image shows us the bike sharing programs peak hours during the month of August. From this we can see that generally the highest peaks are during the average workday commute times: 7am - 9am and 4pm - 7pm. This tells us that the greatest use users get is when trying to go to work or go home from work.
